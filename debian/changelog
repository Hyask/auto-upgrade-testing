auto-upgrade-testing (0.2) kinetic; urgency=medium

  * New version 0.2.
  * Main functional changes since 0.1:
    - virt-qemu: bump the reboot timeout to 300s
    - upgrade: allow LTS-to-LTS upgrades if available
    - fixed arguments of autopkgtest following migration from adt
    - Rename adt-* to autopkgtest-*
    - qemu backend: honor DEFAULT_CPU and DEFAULT_RAM
    - d/t/upgrade: the switches -p and -d for do-release-upgrade are mutually
      exclusive so only use -d
    - d/t/upgrade: drop support for deprecated/abandoned backends
    - d/t/upgrade: use the dist-upgrader from -proposed since that
      has fixes that affect upgrading e.g. LP: #1796193
    - Adding keep-overlay option to persist the resulting image file in
      order to be able to run system tests after the upgrade is done.
